# CS1800
Python module housing tools for solving problems in CS1800 - Discrete Structures at Northeastern University.

Students of this course may find find this very useful if they already know Python.  Each function has a docstring.

Most (if not all, I haven't tried) of these functions will work symbolically with the "sympy" library.  Useful for prime factorization and such.
